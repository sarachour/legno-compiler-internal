\chapter{Quickstart}

The \tx{exp_driver} tool automatically executes and plots the waveforms
of \grendel scripts. First we use \expdriver to scan for \grendel scripts to execute:

\begin{lstlisting}
  python3 exp_driver.py scan
\end{lstlisting}

This command automatically searches for any \grendel scripts in the \tx{outputs}
directory and adds them to the experiment database~\cite{experiment.db}. The
experiment database tracks the execution and analysis results of each
experiment. Note that the \tx{exp_driver} tool can only work with files that
have been generated using the \legno compiler.

Next we tell the \expdriver tool to execute any pending experiments. An
experiment is marked as pending the waveforms produced by the \grendel script do
not exist yet. 

\begin{lstlisting}
  python3 exp_driver run --calibrate
\end{lstlisting}

The \tx{--calibrate} flag tells the \expdriver command to calibrate any
blocks that require calibration. Note that the \tx{--calib-obj} flag is
automatically inferred from the model used to compile the script.
