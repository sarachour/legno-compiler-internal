# TODO List

1. Does the new calibration scheme preserve linearity?

# Enumeration of Contributions:

## Calibration

 - calibration / profiling loop for building parameter dataset.
   - empirical analysis (noise is low, bias can be significant)
   - found bugs with analog hardware guy's calibration routine. (nonlinear multiplier bug)
   - 
   - offline predictive techniques (TODO??)
   
 - *if necessary*: bias correction technique.
