1. Profile a multiplier (h/h/h)

RQ1: Can we model the amplitude response as a function of the chosen gain?
   - if we take target/error, does it make more sense?
   - how complicated of a model do we need?
   - can this model be mitigated by jaunt?
   - does this model generalize across components?

RQ2: Are there gains of the multiplier that are simply not accessible?
